Welcome to my blog.

This is hopefully going to be a place to share what's happening in my studies and work. I am hoping to find some cool stuff to put here as I gain more experience and start to work on more exciting things.

I guess this will also be a bit of a devlog for my personal projects, CTF writeups and other misc endeavours.

I've never been great at keeping a journal so this may be doomed to failure, but I'm hoping that posting about my adventures in cyberspace will give me a reason to keep up with it this time.
