## Introduction

Hack The Box Academy (HTB Academy) is an excellent resource for learning cybersecurity skills, but finding solutions and deeper explanations for its questions can be difficult and confusing for beginners. Many answers are scattered across the internet—or unavailable altogether—leaving users frustrated and spending hours/days/weeks on particularly tricky problems.

I've decided to create a dedicated resource to address this on my blog. This series of posts will not only provide solutions but also offer detailed explanations of how I arrived at them. Many challenges require creative problem-solving and unconventional thinking, so my goal is to make these posts a valuable supplement to the official HTB Academy modules and a good resource for cybersecurity students and professionals attempting the exams.

## What to Expect

This resource will cover the three main learning paths offered by HTB Academy:

- Bug Bounty Hunter
- SOC Analyst
- Pentester

Each module will be covered with a summary of the topics covered, answers for any questions and when required, a deep dive in the topic the module is covering. 

My hope is that this series becomes a useful "cheat sheet" for learners preparing for HTB Academy modules and exams.

## Bug Bounty Hunter

- [Module 1: Web Requests]({% post_url 2025-01-29-m35-webrequests %})

- [Module 3: Using Web Proxies]()
- [Module 11: File Injection Attacks]({% post_url   2025_01_01-m136-fileuploadattacks})

**Note:** *Additional paths and modules will be added as I am able to write them.*
