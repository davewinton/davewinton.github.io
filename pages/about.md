# whois: Dave Winton 

Hey there! I\'m Dave, a lifelong tech geek whose love affair with
computers started way back in the mid-\'90s. It all began when my dad
brought home our first family PC---a clunky beast running Windows 95 on
that glacial 28kbps dial-up internet. Sure, it was ancient by today\'s
standards, but it opened up a world of possibilities beyond just
blasting through the \"100-in-1\" DOS games that came with the CD-ROMs
packaged with the computer.

#### My Dad: Tech Sensei

My dad was the real deal---no formal education but self-taught, sharp as
a tack, and a natural problem-solver. He showed me the ropes, from
troubleshooting those frequent computer hiccups on old systems to
navigating the wild west of the early internet. We even teamed up to
build a website back in the day, proudly showcasing my \"Pok√©mon of the
Week\" picks. (It was groundbreaking stuff in the \'90s, trust me.) Honestly, he\'s
the reason I fell head over heels for tech and that kicked off a journey
that\'s been rolling strong for over 30 years.

#### What Makes Me Tick

Computers are my playground, my happy place, and I love tinkering with them to make life
easier (and more fun). Whether it's automating tasks, coding,
making music, editing photos and videos, gaming, or configuring and locking systems
down for security, I'm all in for the ride. Journey before destination.

#### The Journey So Far

I majored in Engineering during my time at university, but my real
\"Eureka!\" moment was An \"Intro to Programming\" class that was
mandatory for all first year Engineering students. I'd always loved computers, but that's where I
discovered my love of Linux and programming, opening doors I didn't even
know existed. Since then, I've been on a (mostly) self-taught mission to master
programming languages, frameworks, security best practices and the art
of good development.

#### What I'm Working On

These days, outside of family life my free time is a mix of personal projects and learning. 
I'm diving into seriously studying networking and pentesting at the moment, aiming to add some shiny
cybersecurity certifications and new knowledge to my toolkit over the next few years.

occasional tech rants.
